## My process

### Built with

  -lodash functions
  -more in hands

### Continued development

I am planning to add some transition effects while updating the phases.

### Useful resources

- [Lodash](https://lodash.com) -I used this to cut the elements array in to three smaller arrays 2 of length 2, 1 of length 1, I rendered each array as a row in the App component, I did this to get stylish arrangement of the elements using flexbox in each of the rows.
